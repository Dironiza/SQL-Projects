This project focuses on the Chinook Database, which contains comprehensive data from a music store, including extensive details about music tracks, albums, artists, customers, and sales transactions.

In this project, I utilized the extensive dataset within the Chinook Database to address various business questions essential for understanding and enhancing the music store's operations. By analyzing data from several interconnected tables, I was able to derive valuable insights that support informed decision-making.

This project not only showcased the practical use of database management and SQL querying techniques but also highlighted the significance of data-driven decision-making in the music retail sector. The insights obtained from the Chinook Database can play a crucial role in refining business strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and ultimately boosting sales growth for the music store.
